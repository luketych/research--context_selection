# Project Milestones

## Phase 1: MCP Prototype (Weeks 1-4)

### Milestone 1.1: Technology Validation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Determine if gitmcp is suitable for our needs
- [ ] Research and install gitmcp
- [ ] Test basic MCP connectivity
- [ ] Evaluate filtering capabilities
- [ ] Document limitations and alternatives
- **Success Criteria**: Clear go/no-go decision on gitmcp
- **Deliverable**: Technology evaluation report

### Milestone 1.2: Working Prototype (Week 2)
**Goal**: Build functional MCP server with visibility control
- [ ] Implement MCP server (gitmcp or custom)
- [ ] Integrate visibility toggle system
- [ ] Create test harness
- [ ] Basic error handling
- **Success Criteria**: Files can be toggled on/off via MCP
- **Deliverable**: Working prototype demo

### Milestone 1.3: Client Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Validate with real MCP clients
- [ ] Test with Claude MCP integration
- [ ] Test with other MCP clients
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Edge case handling
- **Success Criteria**: Stable client connections with dynamic visibility
- **Deliverable**: Client compatibility report

### Milestone 1.4: Documentation & Decision (Week 4)
**Goal**: Complete prototype phase and plan next steps
- [ ] Complete implementation documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security assessment
- [ ] Recommendation for Phase 2
- **Success Criteria**: Production readiness assessment
- **Deliverable**: Phase 1 completion report

## Phase 2: Production Implementation (Future)

### Milestone 2.1: Robust Architecture
- [ ] Production-grade MCP server
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Milestone 2.2: Quartz Frontend
- [ ] Quartz integration
- [ ] Web-based visibility toggles
- [ ] User interface design
- [ ] Responsive design
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

### Milestone 2.3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Pattern-based visibility rules
- [ ] User role management
- [ ] API for programmatic access
- [ ] Webhook integrations
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Milestone 2.4: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Production monitoring
- [ ] Documentation and training
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

## Risk Mitigation Checkpoints

### Technical Risks
- **Week 1**: If gitmcp is unsuitable, pivot to custom MCP server
- **Week 2**: If performance is poor, implement caching layer
- **Week 3**: If client compatibility issues, create adapter layer

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP for Phase 1
- **Over-engineering**: Focus on working prototype first
- **Technology changes**: Monitor MCP specification updates

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Toggle visibility without server restart
- [ ] < 100ms response time for file operations
- [ ] Works with at least 2 different MCP clients
- [ ] Handles 50+ files without performance degradation
- [ ] Zero data loss during visibility changes

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Web UI for non-technical users
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Production-ready security
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- MCP specification stability
- Client support for MCP protocol
- Quartz framework compatibility
- Git repository hosting

### Internal Dependencies
- Prototype validation before Phase 2
