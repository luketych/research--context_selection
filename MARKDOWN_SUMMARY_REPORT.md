# Markdown Files Summary Report

## Current Project Structure

All markdown files are now organized in the `descriptions/` folder, with `CLAUDE.md` remaining at the root level for Claude Code guidance.

## File-by-File Analysis

### 5. **descriptions/PROTOTYPE_README.md**
- **Purpose**: Instructions for working with the current prototype
- **Type**: Operational documentation
- **Content**: Quick start guide, current status checklist, next steps for prototype development
- **Current visibility**: ‚ùå Hidden in MCP

### 6. **descriptions/overview.md**
- **Purpose**: Sample context file demonstrating the project concept
- **Type**: Example/template
- **Content**: Basic project overview with key features and architecture notes

## Current Visibility Status

**Visible to MCP clients** (5 files):
- ‚úÖ HIGH_LEVEL_IDEA.md
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION_PROPOSAL.md
- ‚úÖ overview.md
- ‚úÖ api-reference.md

**Hidden from MCP clients** (2 files):
- ‚ùå architecture.md
- ‚ùå NEXT_STEPS.md
- ‚ùå PROTOTYPE_README.md

## Purpose Analysis

The collection serves multiple purposes:

1. **Strategic Documentation**: HIGH_LEVEL_IDEA.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PROPOSAL.md define the project's vision and execution strategy

2. **Operational Guidance**: CLAUDE.md, NEXT_STEPS.md, and PROTOTYPE_README.md provide instructions for development work

3. **Sample Content**: overview.md, architecture.md, and api-reference.md demonstrate the type of context files that would be managed by the system

4. **Proof of Concept**: The visibility control system is already working - different files are selectively exposed to demonstrate the core functionality

## Key Insights

1. **Self-Documenting System**: The project uses itself as a demonstration - the descriptions folder contains both the project documentation AND sample content showing how the system would work

2. **Layered Documentation**: From high-level vision to specific implementation details to operational instructions

3. **Working Prototype**: The visibility control system is functional and can be tested with the existing content

4. **Clear Separation**: Project documentation vs. sample content is clearly delineated

The markdown files collectively represent a complete project lifecycle from conception to prototype, with the system already demonstrating its core functionality through selective file visibility.
